    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am Sneha Latha Kusuma, a dedicated and versatile software developer with a strong passion for building innovative and user-centric applications. With a solid foundation in front-end and back-end development, I thrive on transforming complex requirements into seamless, scalable solutions. I earned my master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Central Missouri, where I deepened my expertise in programming, web technologies, and project development. My academic and professional journey has equipped me with advanced skills in Python, Angular, JavaScript, and SQL, along with a strong understanding of cloud infrastructure, database management, and UI/UX design principles.
<br>Professionally, I have gained valuable experience as a UI Designer and Web Developer, working on dynamic and diverse projects. Notable projects include the E-learning Quizzing Platform, which I developed using Python and Angular, integrating REST APIs and responsive design for an exceptional user experience. Another highlight is my Object Recognition project, where I applied deep learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to accurately detect objects in images and videos. Additionally, my Brake Failure Indicator project showcases my ability to integrate hardware with software, designing a system that provides real-time feedback through visual and audio alerts.
<br>I am certified in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and SQL, demonstrating my commitment to mastering foundational and advanced technologies. Beyond my technical skills, I excel in problem-solving, collaboration, and adapting to fast-paced, agile environments. I enjoy working closely with cross-functional teams to deliver solutions that meet user needs and exceed expectations. My passion for learning drives me to continuously explore emerging technologies, such as React, Vue.js, and advanced Angular features, ensuring that I stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
<br>Currently, I am based in Overland Park, KS, and I am actively seeking opportunities that allow me to contribute my technical expertise while furthering my professional growth. I am particularly interested in roles that emphasize innovative problem-solving, team collaboration, and impactful development. With a strong work ethic, a creative mindset, and a results-oriented approach, I am eager to make a meaningful contribution to any team I join.

        <h3>E-learning Quizzing Platform</h3>
        <p>
            The E-learning and Quizzing Platform was developed during my Master's program as a comprehensive educational tool designed to enhance the learning experience through interactive quizzes and assessments. Built using Python and Angular, this platform allows users to engage with various learning modules and test their knowledge with quizzes on different subjects. The backend is powered by Python, which handles user data, quiz logic, and dynamic content generation, while the frontend is built with Angular, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface. The platform integrates REST APIs to manage user interactions, quiz results, and real-time progress tracking. Key features include customizable quizzes, instant feedback, and a dashboard for users to track their performance. The project showcases my ability to combine both frontend and backend technologies to create a seamless, engaging, and scalable educational platform that encourages active learning and self-assessment. Additionally, the platform was designed with a focus on user experience, ensuring that learners can easily navigate and interact with the system while improving their knowledge through targeted quizzes.

        <h3>Object Recognition</h3>
        <p> 
            The Object Recognition Project is a deep learning-based application developed during my Bachelor's program, aimed at detecting and classifying objects within images and videos. Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this project applied advanced machine learning techniques to process and identify multiple objects in visual data with high accuracy. The model was trained on large, labeled datasets, such as COCO or ImageNet, to recognize a wide range of everyday objects. The application not only highlights the power of deep learning in image processing but also demonstrates my ability to implement CNN architectures for complex tasks such as object detection. This project laid a strong foundation in the field of computer vision, showcasing my ability to integrate machine learning algorithms with practical applications. By utilizing Python and popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras, I was able to create a robust system capable of real-time object recognition, making it suitable for various use cases, including surveillance, robotics, and automated systems.

        <h3>Weather App</h3>
        <p>The Weather App is an intuitive and practical web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver real-time weather updates to users. Designed with simplicity and functionality in mind, the app provides users with accurate weather data sourced from an external API like OpenWeatherMap. By entering a city name or allowing geolocation, users receive up-to-date information, including current temperature, humidity levels, wind speed, and general weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, or cloudy). The app’s JavaScript functionality dynamically fetches and displays this data, ensuring that the information stays current and relevant.
